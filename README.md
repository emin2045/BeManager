# BeManager
***
Suppose that you are the manager of a football club. You are expected to sign free contract
players for your team with the given budget of $X. The owner of the club will fire you if you
spend money more than $X (You are allowed to spend less than $X). You are considering N
different positions (such as Goalkeeper, Defender, Forward etc.). For each position in a team,
there are K players who are available to play that specific position. However, you must sign at
most one player for each position. If you do not sign any players at a particular position, then
you plan to stick with the players you already have for that position.
***
Each player has three main information:

 The player’s position:

 The amount of money that will cost to sign the player:

 The player’s rating.
***
The goal is to maximize the total ratings of players you signed while spending no more than
$X.

NOTE: The splitting operations designed for .txt files.Contains greedy approach,dynamic programming ,heap sort, knapsack problem and rod cutting.

Greedy Algorithms’ and Dynamic Programming’s time complexity is different from each other. For example, Dynamic Programming bigger than Greedy Algorithm’s. However, Greedy Algorithm results are incorrect occasionally on the other hand Dynamic Programming always find the correct solution.
